# GameProject4
Role: System/Gameplay Programmer, Technical Artist, "Character Artist"

## Components & Data Assets
I designed the components to be as independent as possible, forwarding most of the connections to the Blueprint side of things.

I did it like this so that the Designers could use the components and their information in what ever way they wanted.

I designed the data assets to be const data containers, only modifyable by users and read only from code / blueprint.

## Materials
I mostly created materials for UI and characters.

I also created a material for faking columns/pillars/supports in the HUB to improve framerate.

How ever, it was never implemented in the game.

## Character Art

I modelled and textured the player character from the ground up, using Blender and Substance Designer.

Petter used my base meshes from player character to turn it into the base for the enemies, which I then modified a little bit and then textured.

## Other
I also created the temporary HUD, with blueprint logic, which we used in the beginning, and contained a temporary emotion bar.

I also helped out as a "technical support" some times.
